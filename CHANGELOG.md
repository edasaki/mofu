- project has been transferred to rococo and is back in business!
- mofu will be rewritten (once again...) into a Java backend, with a web frontend (but this time on an actual website)

- added explicit typing declarations to tsconfig (maybe not necessary)
- added string-key dictionary; currently unused, turns out you can't iterate it very easily so it's not all that useful...
- added search result listing component (currently combines all listings from one source into a single component, may need to eventually split further)

## 0.1.8 - Apr 29 2017
- forced scrollbars to have no style for now (might use custom styling in the future since electron is webkit)
- got MangaHere backend searching working! (backend as in, it doesn't display anything yet)

- began complete rewrite of misakachan (now known as mofu)
- new tech stack is Electron+Typescript+React+Webpack+SASS+bit of jquery/js

- added new caching system (incomplete, only a prototype atm)

## 0.0.44 - Feb 18 2017
- fixed another null pointer issue
- wrote a ton of code to try to get past a cookie issue, only to get cheesed by same-origin policy (always forget it exists lol)
- since it was a lot of code (maybe stuff worth reusing in the future?), I'll push this commit now and restart in the next commit

## 0.0.43 - Feb 18 2017
- info & download panels now work much better on unusual window sizes
- manga page url conversion now takes collections instead of list

- realized that I only need to use phantomjs to get the cookies, not actually access pages afterwards lol
- greatly improved WebAccessor - now loads most things pretty quickly, especially after it finishes preloading
- finished kissmanga search results! Halfway there :D Once I finish KissManga I can wrap up some other features, I just wanted to make sure I had at least two sources working.

## 0.0.39 - Feb 16 2017
- finished first version of cloudflare bypass - fully functional, but it's not threadsafe and is blocking so it ain't that great :(
- cloudflare bypass now preloads on a separate thread
- added WebAccessor preloading - usually takes ~8 seconds on my computer, could be slower on worse internet connection so I'll work on improving it
- basically sites that use Cloudflare (like KissManga) make my life a lot harder lol

## 0.0.38 - Feb 16 2017
- added solo tag to test classes to run just that class easily
- mostly finished cloudflare bypass, bit stuck on a weird bug
- super-mini-patch ## 0.0.38.1: fixed the bug I think! Seems to work now :)

## 0.0.37 - Feb 13 2017
- fixed bug with non-integer chapter numberings
- whipped up a quick auto pom updater that changes the build version to match what's in this file

## 0.0.36 - Feb 13 2017
- finished first fully functional prototype of manga downloading!

## 0.0.35 - Feb 12 2017
- added scrollbar to chapter download panel
- finished backend reading the urls from download panel - just need to wrap up the code to actually download a chapter directly from URL now!

## 0.0.34 - Feb 11 2017
- chapters now show up properly in the new chapter download panel

## 0.0.33 - Feb 11 2017
- added explicit jetty dependencies to prevent dependency conflicts
- finally figured out how to set listeners for dynamically created elements (I am a jQuery noob hehe)
- on a side note, scripts.js is extremely messy right now - rest assured it'll be refactored at some point!
- made a lot of progress on download UI - basically done, now just need to do the program stuff (loading in chapters into the panel and downloading)

## 0.0.32 - Feb 10 2017
- Added ExperimentalTests for playing around with code
- added dependencies: Selenium and bonigarcia's web driver manager (for automated management of PhantomJS drivers on any OS)
- added working experimental code for bypassing kissmanga cloudflare protection with headless phantomjs browser thru selenium
- in layman's terms, basically on some websites you see those cloudflare "Please wait 5 seconds while we verify your browser" etc. etc. messages. Those cause some pretty difficult issues for bots like misakachan (well, that's kind of the point I guess). I managed to write a workaround that gets past that by imitating an actual browser, so now we should have no problems retrieving sites like KissManga, etc!

## 0.0.31 - Feb 8 2017

- added simple timer utility for debugging
- fixed multithreading issue with document cache initialization

## 0.0.27 - Feb 3 2017
- fixed clearing pages on new chapter
- started work on chapter downloading (almost done with it I think, just a couple last bugs to iron out)

## 0.0.26 - Feb 2 2017
- top/bottom arrows are now slightly lower and sticky. the code to make them sticky but not overflow into the footer is actually pretty wacky, may try to improve in the future altho it seems to work quite well (surprisingly hard to make it not have weird snaps)
- added a super basic light theme (for personal use only at the moment - official builds will only have the dark theme until I add a theme switcher)
- added a download button (doesn't do anything yet, just sits there looking cute)
- fixed a bug with the above padded fixed divs (need to account for children for whatever reason) - now works super smoothly for both the arrows and the download button!

## 0.0.21 - Jan 30 2017
- mostly wrapped up scanlator group stuff, will add it to info panel in next patch
- added images for each manga to search results - another surprisingly tricky to code thing, because it turns out some/most sites don't show images on the search results page so I have to fetch the image from each manga page, which needs to be multithreaded..
- fixed mangahere descriptions to pull the full description

## 0.0.20 - Jan 29 2017
- finished json serialization for Series objects
- mostly wrapped up manga popup display! just need to finish chapters and a bit of formatting stuff

## 0.0.19 - Jan 29 2017
- added automatic update checking - surprisingly difficult to code thanks to my laziness - I didn't want to have to remember to update a variable somewhere every build, so instead I made it so this changelog is automatically included in the compiled JAR. But I didn't really know how to do that so it took a while to figure out the right maven config. And then I had to make sure that I can run it locally still, while also having it able to get the resource stream from the jar. 
- fixed a typo with version initialization
- added version string display
- added message queueing to console to be able to ready messages before the GUI is loaded

- added some multithreading functionality
- started work on general search function, only have a prototype ready, i'm still working out how it should work for the user
- added some tests
- added Discord chat link

- added automatic changelog fetching and display

## 0.0.13 - Jan 22 2017
- worked on some more styling
- added my own version of momentum scrolling on WASD/Arrow Keys - actually was a huge pain to code haha
- multithreaded page crawling - HUGE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT!!!!!! I was super surprised at how much faster it got! A 36 page chapter of Railgun from MangaHere took ~13 seconds to load before; multithreaded, it loads all 36 pages in under a second!

## 0.0.12 - Jan 22 2017
- added auto SASS formatting builder to eclipse project - it doesn't run on auto build b/c it does some weird stuff if it does
- converted old style.css to SASS - first time using SASS, pretty cool stuff
- removed source mapping for SASS - not doing anything complex enough to need it lol
- fixed extra padding at bottom of image divs - was an issue with vertical-align
- switched to more modularized var naming for scss _colors
- as a side note, until release I will only be using the "PATCH" part of semantic versioning. No point doing "MINOR" patches when misaka isn't ready yet anyways and I'm working on this solo :P

## 0.0.11 - Jan 20 2017
- recoded BakaUpdateSearcher to search directly within the site instead of using google
- so far it seems to search with pretty great accuracy - first checks for direct phrase matches, and then compares between those by finding the shortest edit distance

## 0.0.10 - Jan 19 2017
- updated readme.md
- coded some stuff to search for manga on baka-updates
- currently prone to rate-limiting b/c it's parsing google. 
-- Will consider recoding to use baka-updates search interface (but will need to think about how to determine which link is the right one). Tired now though so I'm going to sleep lol

## 0.0.9 - Jan 19 2017
- added stuff for using SASS for CSS
- auto transpiler builder included for Eclipse - automatically updates generated CSS on auto builds
